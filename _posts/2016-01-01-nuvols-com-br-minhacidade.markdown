The holidays from the beginning of the year the great is visiting the capital where the sun rises first, João Pessoa, and enjoy the wonders how picãozinho, ponta do seixas, alligator and red sand beach. And in the middle of the year the cool thing is to enjoy the season of freshwater beaches of Palms, the youngest of the capitals, that besides the beaches there's also waterfalls of taquarussu.
